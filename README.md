3) Record a video from a webcam with OpenCV and save it to the disk with mp4 compression

# Homework 2 &#10003;

Tasks:

1) Use the city map image to annotate it by clicking on the starting point of the route, intermediate points
to be connected with lines in order to indicate the route along the streets to reach the end point

2) Create a bird's eye view video from a fixed camera using perspective transformation and save it to a file

3) Annotate a video fragment with text and save the annotated video to a file

# Homework 3 &#10003;

Tasks:
1) For HSV color model, build a circle with Hue & Saturation channels, and an additional bar with adjusting slider for Value
channel

2) Make a possibility to choose a point in circle by using a mouse button

3) Invert the selected color point to RGB, LAB and YCrCb colors, and output the computed values in a window

# Homework 4 &#10003;

Tasks:
1) Corrupt an image with salt-and-pepper noise (using adjustable proportions for salt-and-pepper noise, e.g. from 10 to 90%)

2) Filter the image with Averaging, Median, Gaussian blur, and Bilateral Filtering using OpenCV, and compare the result images

# Homework 5

Tasks:
1) Corrupt an image with a noise (using an adjusting slider to change the noise propotions, e.g. from 10 to 90%)

2) Filter the image with Frequency Filtering (Mean Filter, Gaussian, etc.) using Numpy and OpenCV, and compare the result
images with relevant convolution filters

3) Find the edges with Frequency Filters (Laplacian, Sobel X and Y, Sharr X and Y) using Numpy / OpenCV, and compare the
result images with the relevant convolution filters
